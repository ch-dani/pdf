                        <p>PDF files are known to be the most popular document and this is because back in 2008, this
                            format
                            was opened to the public which later on became the universal format for all platforms. It
                            can be
                            distributed online, printed, and can be read on any device. It has been used by plenty of
                            companies and government agencies for surveys, forms, and distribution of information as it
                            has
                            been sought out as the safest way to do so. While corporations see this as their gold mine
                            for
                            gathering information, we may wonder how else can this be utilized to earn some extra
                            dough.</p>
                        <img src="img/image_post_1.png" alt="">
                        <p>Back in 2007, an announcement has been made by Yahoo services to allow ads inserted in PDF
                            which
                            was called “Ads for Adobe PDF.” This new advertising program allowed plenty of publishers to
                            add
                            pay-per-click (PPC) ads in the form of a panel inside the file and allow earning when
                            readers
                            click it. If you’re familiar with web PPC ads, this is not so different from those. To
                            enable
                            the PDF ads, authors will only need to sign up for an account, submit the PDF to Yahoo and a
                            maximum of 5 ads will be displayed. Of course, you won’t be earning in an instant! You still
                            have to distribute them to readers and get some clicks before you get paid.</p>
                        <p>The Yahoo PDF ads didn’t last very long. The beta phase that allowed only a few U.S. based
                            account holders wasn’t a big hit due to the number of limitations and several requirements.
                            That’s why if you search for that program now, you won’t be seeing anything other than 2007
                            articles. But don’t worry, this isn’t the end of passive earnings. You can actually do much
                            more
                            with PDF.</p>

                        <h2>Ways to Earn Money from Creating PDF</h2>
                        <p>Let’s start with the basics. (1) eBook. Creating PDF is free and easy to make but the content
                            should be high in quality – something that people would search for and has real answers to
                            their
                            concerns. Nowadays, people look for solutions and not just trends. Earning some extra dough
                            can
                            be gained simply by providing the information people need and it could be in a form of an
                            eBook!
                            Just set a certain fee for every electronic book and allow download once paid!</p>
                        <img src="img/image_post_2.png" alt="">
                        <p>(2) If writing books isn’t your forte, then you can opt for links instead. Short and simple
                            PDF
                            blogs can contain your website’s links and redirect the reader to buy from your array of
                            products. All you need to do is gather subscribers and convert them into buyers through your
                            PDF’s content.</p>
						<?php include "inc/banner.php"; ?>
                        <p>(3) If you’re an influencer or at least, have a substantial following subscribed to you with
                            their emails listed, then you can take PDF up a notch by getting direct sponsors and
                            advertisers. Let’s say you want to sent a Christmas greeting to all your subscribers, you
                            can
                            actually propose huge brands to participate in this by paying you advertiser’s fees in
                            exchange
                            to adding their logo on the card.</p>
                        <img src="img/image_post_3.png" alt="">
                        <p>(4) Not everyone can be a writer so this last option will be perfect if you don’t have those
                            talents. This option for earning some extra cash is called Dropshipping and affiliate
                            marketing.
                            We know for sure you’ve heard about this but do you know how it works? Both systems works
                            purely
                            online through links and is usually done with websites, blogs, and microblogs. A certain
                            link or
                            code is provided by the brand to the author, which will also be used by the buyer later on.
                            Once
                            the PDF is distributed and the link is clicked by the reader, they will be redirected to the
                            brand’s product and once the buyer makes a purchase using the link (or the code), a certain
                            commission will automatically be given to the author of the PDF. If you have a substantial
                            amount of connections, you can actually create a digital brochure with inspirational pegs
                            then
                            send it to your directory. No writing is needed but a few details may still be required just
                            so
                            your receiver won’t be confused with your email.</p>
                        <img src="img/image_post_4.png" alt="">
                        <p>(5) The last method is in the form of service. You can be the creative designer of companies
                            that
                            want to have their PDF but don’t exactly know how OR you can also gather information using
                            PDF
                            forms on behalf of companies. This service may not be easy to do for simple Joes though as
                            it
                            requires some artistic skills or some knowledge about the company’s niche.</p>
